## Description

- The purpose of this assignment was to implement the concept of polymorphism by using parent and child class constructors, to begin understanding TDD with Jest unit testing, and to practice more with the Inquirer package.

This is a WIP! See below for my progress!

## Acceptance Criteria Progress Checklist

- [x] GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for text
- [x] THEN I can enter up to three characters
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for the text color
- [x] THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for a shape
- [x] THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
- [x] WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
- [x] THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
- [x] WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
- [x] THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
      AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
- [x] WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
- [x] THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered

### Additionally:

- [x] Implement unit testing using Jest
- [x] WHEN I run the test in the terminal, all tests pass.

- [ ] WHEN I go through my code, it has been tested and refactored to the best of my ability.
